Java omni-completion for Vim 7.x

Starting point of the projec is: 
* https://github.com/VictorDenisov/javacomplete, by Victor Denisov, which in turn is started by 
* http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1785, created by Mr. Fang Cheng. 

I do not take credit for any of the work, I have contacted the authors about these modifications.

Modifications

javacomplete.vim is a vim plugin that uses
* a java parser written in plain vim for completion in source code files. 
* a java reflection class written in java for completion from jars / .class files

I have made the following changes:

* added javacomplete#GoToDefinition; should open the definition of any varible inside the file, or outside
* changed the Reflection.java mechanism with a new tool, that
** introspects and saves caches with parsed source / introspection data for both source and binary classes

* the vim script parser is kept for the current file.
